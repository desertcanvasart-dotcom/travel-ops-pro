-- 20261107_expense_from_supplier_confirmation.sql
-- Confirming a supplier on a booking (booking_supplier_status → confirmed)
-- now records what the trip owes them as an expense (lib/bookings/
-- supplier-expense.ts): until then every trip cost had to be typed in by
-- hand, and an un-typed trip showed ~100% margin. This column ties the
-- expense to the row that made it, so a later cost change updates it and an
-- un-confirmation removes it — once, never a second copy.
--
-- ON DELETE SET NULL: removing the supplier row keeps the expense (it may be
-- approved or paid already). Additive and replay-safe.
