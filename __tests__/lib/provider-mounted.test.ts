// Every exported React context Provider must actually be MOUNTED somewhere.
//
// GET-C03 in the sibling (QA, 31 Aug): its ModalContext shipped a polished confirm-dialog system
// whose Provider was mounted nowhere. Its useModal() hook returned a no-op
// fallback whose confirmDestructive resolved false — so destructive actions on
// three modules silently did nothing, forever, with only a dev-console
// warning. The component tree looked complete; the wiring did not exist.
//
// This app carried the IDENTICAL file — unmounted, and here with zero
// consumers: pure trap-in-waiting, deleted with this test. This scan makes that state unrepresentable: a Provider nobody mounts fails
// the suite by name. The fix is either to mount it or to delete the file —
// an unmounted provider with a silent fallback is a trap, not a utility.
