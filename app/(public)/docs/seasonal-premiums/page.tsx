        Some dates are simply worth more &mdash; Christmas, New Year, cherry-blossom week, a local
        festival. A seasonal premium is your way of saying &ldquo;anything travelling in this window
        costs a bit more&rdquo; without touching a single supplier rate.
      </p>

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">A premium on the whole price</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
          A seasonal premium is applied to the <strong>whole trip price, after your margin</strong>
          &mdash; not to the underlying costs. Set a window and a percentage in{' '}
          <strong>Settings &rarr; Seasonal Premiums</strong>, and any quote whose travel dates fall in
          that window is lifted by that percentage automatically.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          This is deliberately different from a{' '}
          <Link href="/docs/rate-periods" className="text-primary-600 hover:underline">rate period</Link>,
          which changes what a specific hotel or cruise <em>costs</em> on a given date. A rate
          period is the supplier&rsquo;s contract; a seasonal premium is your commercial decision on
          top of it.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Dated windows</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
          Each premium is a dated window &mdash; a From date, a To date and a percentage &mdash; and
          you can add as many as the year needs. The dates carry the year, so a premium written for
          this year&rsquo;s peak does not silently apply to next year&rsquo;s.
        </p>
        <Tip>
          A trip is matched by its travel date, not the date you quote it. Quote a Christmas trip in
          July and it still picks up the December premium.
