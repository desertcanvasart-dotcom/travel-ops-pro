        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
          Extras are priced <strong>off-margin</strong> &mdash; the price you set is the price the
          traveller pays, not a cost the app then marks up. That keeps a clean, published price for
          a balloon ride the same whether it rides on a high-margin trip or a low-margin one.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Each row carries its <strong>own currency</strong>, so an insurance product priced in yen
          and an excursion priced in dollars can sit side by side and each bills in its own money.

        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
          From an <Link href="/docs/itineraries" className="text-primary-600 hover:underline">itinerary</Link>,
          pick the extras the traveller wants; they appear on the quote and the invoice as their own
          lines, separate from the trip price.
        </p>
        <Tip>
          Because extras sit outside the margin maths, they are the right home for anything you
          resell at a fixed published price &mdash; insurance especially.
