// ============================================
// The cost breakdown reads like the day runs
// ============================================
// The engine emits its lines in the order it happens to compute them — guide
// and tips first, then airport and hotel assistance, then the night, then
// entrance fees, meals, water, and transport last — and the old sort pushed
// every fixed cost ahead of every per-person one on top of that. An operator
// checking a quote against the programme read a day as a shuffled list and
// could not see what was missing (operator, 2026-09-16).
//
// This is the one ordering rule, shared by the engine's result and the
// calculator page, so a saved quote's lines are in the same order as the
// screen that produced them. Pure: no database, no framework.
//
// Within a day the order is the day's own flow: breakfast, leaving the hotel,
// the travel leg and the transfers around it, arriving at the next hotel, the
// guide and the sights, lunch, dinner, the night's bed, and the day's tips.
// Lines with no day (a rooming adjustment, a whole-trip extra) come last.

/** The fields the rule needs. Engine lines and B2B response lines both map to it. */
