// ============================================
// What a portal link may see, and answer, about extras
// ============================================
// The whole of the portal's authority over options and upgrades, as pure
// functions — because "which traveller may accept this charge?" is exactly the
// kind of rule that should not be buried in a query builder.
//
// A booking-level (family) link is the lead's: it sees the party's extras and
// each traveller's. A private per-traveller link is ONE PERSON'S and sees only
// their own — the same rule the traveller forms and the party-size request
// already follow, and the reason those links exist at all.
