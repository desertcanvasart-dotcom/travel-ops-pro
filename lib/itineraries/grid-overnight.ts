// ============================================
// A Pricing Grid save's overnight cities
// ============================================
// The grid has one city per day — where the day is SPENT. The save used to
// store it as the night's city too, so a day trip to Alexandria from a Cairo
// hotel said "Overnight in Alexandria". The night is where its bed is: the
// accommodation picked that day (its city in Rates) or the cruise (on board),
// resolved by the shared rule (overnight-city.ts). Ported from autoura-saas
// (#582, #586) — this app's save wrote `overnight_city: day.city` the same way,
// so its supplier documents, which now group a night by where the bed is, put
// a grid-made day trip's hotel and vehicle under the day-trip city.
