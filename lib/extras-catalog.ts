// ============================================
// The option catalogue — what can be added to a trip
// ============================================
// An extra typed by hand works, but it drifts: two agents name the same tour
// differently, the price is whatever was remembered, no supplier cost comes
// with it (so the P&L reads the whole thing as margin), and nobody can ever
// ask "how much did the balloon ride earn us this year".
//
// So extras are PICKED from a list, and the list is one the operator already
// maintains:
//
//   PACKAGE OPTIONS   tour_variation_services where is_optional — the options
//                     belonging to a specific programme, each with its own
//                     cost_per_unit and an optional_price_override that is the
//                     selling price the operator already decided on.
//   ATTRACTION EXTRAS entrance_fees where is_sellable_extra — a site the
//                     customer can pay to add (the pyramid interior). NOT
//                     is_addon: that flag means "leave out of the automatic
//                     price", which is a different decision and does not imply
//                     this one (operator, 1 Sep).
//   CATALOGUE EXTRAS  extras_catalogue — the things that are not attractions
//                     at all: airport fast-track, extra luggage, late
//                     check-out. Org-scoped and priced the same way.
//
// THE PICKER PRE-FILLS, IT DOES NOT COMMIT. Every price here is a suggestion
// the office can change before the extra is offered, which is why an honest
// null is better than a plausible number: what cannot be priced comes back
// unpriced and says why.
