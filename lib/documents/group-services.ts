// ============================================
// Supplier documents from an itinerary — one per kind of service, per place
// ============================================
// "Generate documents" on an itinerary writes the vouchers and orders sent to
// suppliers. A service with a supplier on it is grouped with that supplier's
// other services, as before. Everything else is grouped here, the way the
// operations tasks are (lib/tasks/itinerary-tasks): by WHAT it is and WHERE
// the party is based, so a four-day Cairo trip gets one transport voucher, one
// hotel voucher, one entrance-fee order — not one per day.
//
// It used to key on each day's own city, so (found in autoura-saas on a live
// trip, ITN-S-2026-8987; this app had the same code):
//   - a day in Giza and a day in Cairo were two Transportation vouchers;
//   - the Alexandria day trip from the Cairo hotel had its own "Alexandria"
//     transport voucher — and its Cairo hotel night an "Alexandria Hotel"
//     voucher, split from the other Cairo nights;
// and regenerating made every one of them again (the duplicate check built
// its key differently from the group's).
//
// WHERE a service belongs:
//   - a night (hotel, cruise) — where the bed is: the day's overnight city;
//   - transport and the guide — where the party is based that day: the
//     overnight city as well, so a day trip's vehicle and guide go with the
//     stay they leave from (the agency's Cairo driver drives to Alexandria);
//   - meals and entrance fees — where they are consumed: the day's own city
//     (the Alexandria restaurant, the Alexandria sites).
// Cities a short drive apart (Giza and Cairo, ~10 km) are one place: the
// first named on the trip names the group.
//
// Entrance fees name their sites. The AI builder writes a day's fees as ONE
// line, "Entrance Fees (non-EUR)", with the sites only in its notes — and the
// PDF never printed notes, so no document said which sites were booked.
//
// Pure: the route and the tests share it. Ported from autoura-saas (#615).
