// ============================================
// Addresses nobody is waiting behind
// ============================================
// A no-reply address does not expect an answer. Two features need to know:
// lead detection must not turn a Twilio notification into a customer, and the
// "waiting on us" list must not fill with them.
//
// Checked against the live data on 2026-09-18: of the 12 conversations the
// waiting list showed, the oldest five were donotreply@twilio.com,
// noreply@twilio.com, ads-noreply@google.com and
// verifymyaccount@twilio.zendesk.com — none of them a customer waiting 38 days
// for an answer. A list that cries wolf is a list nobody reads.
//
// Ported from autoura-saas (#574 among them). Here the waiting list is
// email_conversations.awaiting_reply_since (migration 20261019), read by the
// dashboard's Needs attention and the inbox's badge and filter.
//
// Matched on the address's LOCAL part (before the @), where the name must be a
// word of its own: "ads-noreply@google.com" is a robot, "systemaxx@" and
// "newton@" are people. Plus the domains services send from. Pure, and safe in
// the browser.
