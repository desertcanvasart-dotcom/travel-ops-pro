// ============================================
// What an optional service adds to a quote
// ============================================
// Decided 2026-08-28: options are priced OFF-MARGIN. When the operator has set
// a price for an option — `tour_variation_services.optional_price_override` —
// that is the price. A margin percentage must not quietly restate it, which is
// what happened while the calculator ignored the column and the extras
// catalogue honoured it: the same balloon ride was 125 before the sale and 140
// after it (docs/plans/extras-and-upgrades.md §6a).
//
// So a chosen option lands in one of two places:
//
//   NO OVERRIDE   its cost joins the margin base and is marked up like every
//                 other service. An option is just a service nobody has priced
//                 separately.
//   OVERRIDE      its price is added AFTER margin, untouched. Its cost is still
//                 counted as cost, because we still pay it — leaving it out
//                 would report the option as pure profit.
//
// The seasonal demand premium still applies to the whole selling price,
// override included. That premium is about the DATE, not the markup, and it has
// always been taken on the whole trip.
