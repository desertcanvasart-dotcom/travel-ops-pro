// ============================================
// FX CONVERSION — "the rate on the day the money moved"
// ============================================
// Converts a foreign-currency cost into a reporting currency using the
// exchange rate that was true on the transaction's own date, not today's.
//
// Why this exists: a trip quoted in EUR whose hotels were paid in EGP three
// months later has an FX result baked into its margin. Summing the raw
// numbers (what the P&L did before) treats 1000 EGP as 1000 EUR — a ~56x
// error. Converting at today's rate is closer, but still reports a margin
// the operator never actually earned.
//
// POLICY (mirrors the pricing harness, lib/pricing-types.ts): a conversion
// that cannot be backed by a real rate is NEVER guessed. It returns basis
// 'none' with a null amount, and the caller records an FxHole and marks the
// result incomplete. Rate sources are always labelled so the operator can
// see which numbers are historical and which fell back to live.
//
// Rate history lives in `exchange_rate_snapshots`, which is append-only.
// `exchange_rates` is upserted and only ever holds today's rate — it cannot
// answer a question about March. Both are created in
// migrations/20260811_share_links_and_fx.sql.
//
// Supported currencies: EUR (base), USD, GBP, EGP, JPY. The resolver is
// currency-agnostic — it works off whatever pairs exist in the history — so
// adding a currency is a change to lib/exchange-rate-api.ts, not to this file.
